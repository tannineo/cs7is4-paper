\begin{abstract}
The concern to veterans' mental health should be made. Existing works show that
mental health changes caused by wars can be relected in linguistic features of
the social media texts. In order to detect and compare those changes we collected
data from 20 soldiers' tweets and examined them with a list of positive and negative
adjectives to indentify the polarity and do comparison with normal users'
tweets. The total counts of tweets vary from 57 to 39,000. We identified the
difference between normal users and soldiers and we did a close look to the
result with discussion.
