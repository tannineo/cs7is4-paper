## meeting record 01

4th March 14PM~15PM

Things we discussed:

- confirmed the roles
  - Recorder: Chao
  - Verifier: Chen
  - Ambassader: Rachit
  - Chair: Sumit
  - Accountant: Chetan
- confirmed the hypothesis
  - the original idea is to identify the sentiment changes of veterans before and after serving in a war
    - hard to collect the time: when they went to a war?
  - identify sentiment changes of veterans through things related to Twitter accounts by comparing with ordinary accounts
    - easy to compare with normal people
    - no need to identify the time of a specific war (when they go to the war)
    - basically using a list of positive and negative words
- confirmed the objective of the reading week
  - 5-6 pages of draft
    - the subtitles/sections must have:
      - research questions
      - literature review
      - research methods
  - works divided
  - on the draft we can put the working data.
- the list of positive negtive words
  - may need to change the list
- consider adding audio data (transcripts from podcasts) to do the analysis.
- try to find characteristics using a list from the paper below
  - "Because... I was told... so much": Linguistic Indicators of Mental Health Status on Twitter
- next meeting on Saturday
